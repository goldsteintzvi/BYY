Hiking packs are great, as they're usually big and they go on your back instead of bumping against your leg every time you take a step. Wheely bags can also be good, although the Old City cobblestones will likely make their mark on the wheels.

                    Rav Nevenzahl's Minyanim on Shabbat
                  </h2>
                  <h3 class="post-subtitle">
                    Rav Nevenzahl has his own Vasikin minyan at the Kotel on Shabbat morning and an early Mincha in his house. After Shacharit, everyone follows him up to his house asking questions as he walks, which he answers. In his house, there's a Kiddush and more questions (usually Parsha-related). Both are opportunities to interact with a Gadol in a very personal way.

                    Just within the Yeshiva, aside from the incredible Rebbeim on staff in both the American and Israeli programs, you have the opportunity to personally interact with people like Rav Nevenzahl and Rav Hadari. It's a rare opportunity to just Daven and learn in the Beis Medrish with them, let alone to ask Rav Hadari a question or be tested by Rav Nevenzahl after Chazara week! Consider keeping a notebook of questions and responses, so you have a record of your personal interactions with Gedolim.

After Shacharit, everyone follows him up to his house asking questions as he walks, which he answers. In his house, there's a Kiddush and more questions (usually Parsha-related). Both are opportunities to interact with a Gadol in a very personal way.

Depending on the time of day, it'll either be empty and serenely quiet or overrun with little kids playing-it's right outside Zilberman's elementary school. It's a wonderful place to take some time to think or relax. Bonus points if you can see the Pasuk on the wall, quoting from Zecharia, played out in front of your eyes.

          <h5 class="mission-statement_text">The Yeshiva's underlying goal is to cultivate Yirat Shamayim as part of a life of Avodat Hashem. The Yeshiva accomplishes this by developing Talmidim’s appreciation of Talmud Torah and its connection to both Am Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael.</h5>
          <h5 class="mission-statement_text">Yeshivat HaKotel was founded more than 40 years ago. The underlying goal of the Yeshiva is to provide its students with a fundamental and intimate connection to Torat Yisrael as it impacts on Am Yisrael in Eretz Yisrael. There is no better place to accomplish this three-fold goal than at Yeshivat HaKotel in the Old City of Jerusalem. The Old City enhances both the emotional and intellectual components of Torah learning. Only someone who has personally experienced this can fully comprehend this added dimension.</h5>
